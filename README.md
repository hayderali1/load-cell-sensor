# load-cell-sensor
# heatlamp systems and avian detterance : thesis relared part 1:
this part is done using STM32 Microcontrollers with multiple actuators(heatlamp and a buzzer) and sensors like weight sensor (loadcell).the main object of this project
is to melt down the accumulated snow on the glass of the camera box.the process is initiated through a tempreture and humidity sensor that sense the present of the rain
above the glass of the camera box,once the sensor sense the present of the rain,the stm32 neucleo microcontroller initiate an electrical pulse that operate a pin which is connected to an electronic relay that operate as an electronic switch for the operation of the heatlamp in accordings with the present of the rain.
# bird detterance system:
the bird detterance part is intigrated into the part of heatlamp,the purpose of this segment is to scare the birds away from standing on the glass.the process is done as the following, the ultrasonic sensor is positioned at the corner of the box is a distance measurment device.is mesures the distance of the objects standing infront of it.
