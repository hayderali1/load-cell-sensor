# load-cell-sensor
# heatlamp systems and avian detterance : thesis relared part 1:
this part is done using STM32 Microcontrollers with multiple actuators(heatlamp and a buzzer) and sensors like weight sensor (loadcell).the main object of this project
is to melt down the accumulated snow on the glass of the camera box.the process is initiated through a tempreture and humidity sensor that sense the present of the rain
above the glass of the camera box,once the sensor sense the present of the rain,the stm32 neucleo microcontroller initiate an electrical pulss that operate a pin which connected
